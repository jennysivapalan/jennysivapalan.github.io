        <h1>300 Seconds</h1>
        <p>January 15, 2014</p>
      
        Women are under represented in the tech world and <a href="http://300seconds.co.uk/" target="_blank">300 Seconds</a> encourages  women  in particular to use the event to gain confidence in public speaking. Each speaker gets 300 seconds to talk about their passion or experiences.
        
        <p>300 seconds is hosted in a different location (primarily London) and  on 11th September 2013 the event came to the Guardian. Encouraged by fellow colleague , Matt Andrews I decided to give it a go.</p>
        
        <p>I work daily on the Content API for the Guardian which will soon be the key source of information for all our platforms. (We currently handle all but desktop site which is being replaced with our responsive site.). I wanted to tell people about the API and why it has been essential to the Guardian.</p>
        
        <p>The key for the talk was getting the content at the right level for the audience. I hadn’t attended a 300 seconds event and I checked out the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/300secondsUK" target="_blank">videos</a> from the previous session. Many of the talks were describing experiences and I decided to take my queue from that and keep the talk to the informative rather than describing the technical layers of our API.</p>

        <p>I wanted to keep the talk to two key aspects, what is an API and why would you want one.  The current Guardian desktop site as the example of web application not using the API. The application code directly call the database which is expensive to do and hard to maintain. However people don’t just use desktops to view information,  today people read the Guardian on smart phones and tablets. Getting each of these applications to make the same calls to the database putting extensive load, duplicate effort and increases the likelihood of inconsistency.</p>

        <p>All this leads to how an API can over come this, how it can do the hard crunching of aggregating the data and giving a consistent format for content when called upon. As long as an API is fast to respond, easy to scale and has a consistent computer readable format (e.g JSON) developers producing then applications no longer need to care about how to pull the data together. Instead developers concentrate just on the design and user-experience of the application. It also means we’ve been able to collaborate with third parties without giving access to our database.</p>

        <p>The last point I wanted to raise was other well known companies with open APIs. Open APIs encourage people to think about new ways to explore and represent data and we’ve had many hacks produced using the Content API.</p>

        <p>Luckily I had some  colleagues who were willing to listen to my presentation before the event and help me tweak it. Practising helped my nerves. The event itself was great, there were talks from how build your own brand, promoting digital learning and why keep calm must die! As for my presentation, I think it came across well. You can see for yourself.</p>

        <p>I’m not comfortable with public speaking and 300 seconds was a great way to test myself. For 5 minutes work there was a lot of preparation needed and I was fairly nervous getting up and talking to a roomful of strangers. But afterwards I felt great. I got two pieces of feedback from the talk (that were not colleagues saying it was good (they were being nice)). One stated it was good but bit techy for him (I’m glad I didn’t go into any further technical details). Another said she’d heard the concept of APIs but the talk made her understand what they actually do. Hooray!</p>

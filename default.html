      <br>March 25, 2014
      <br>The team I work in at the Guardian has been working on a major rewrite of the Content API so that it scales with our new responsive site.  As part of this rewrite, our team has taken ownership of the stack – something that was previously managed by our systems team. For the first time, this has meant the development team has had to think about how we gain confidence that our application is working correctly and how we find out when it isn’t.

      <br>January 15, 2014
      <br>Women are under represented in the tech world and 300 Seconds encourages  women  in particular to use the event to gain confidence in public speaking. Each speaker gets 300 seconds to talk about their passion or experiences.
      300 seconds is hosted in a different location (primarily London) and  on 11th September 2013 the event came to the Guardian. Encouraged by fellow colleague , Matt Andrews I decided to give it a go.

     <br>January 4, 2014
     <br>This is the year I start writing things down properly and the start of this blog. I’ve learnt a lot from some clever people over the years both in person and via blogs and sites such as stackoverflow.  In the past I’ve used email or Pocket to share this with others or keep a handy reference for myself. This is fine until I actually need to search again for the information that is older than a month. I’m hoping this blog will change that and help to remind me of some the good and bad things I’ve tried over the years.

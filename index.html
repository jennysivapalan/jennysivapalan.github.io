        I am a software engineer working at <a href="http://www.theguardian.com">The Guardian</a>. I have worked on interesting projects such as <a href="https://github.com/guardian/frontend">Dotcom website</a>, <a href="https://github.com/guardian/membership-frontend">Guardian Membership</a> and the <a href="http://open-platform.theguardian.com/">Content API</a>. 
        I've recently moved to the Editorial Tools team which produces the publishing tools for the Guardian. With this move I'll be taking on a Dev Manager role which means I'll help people manage their careers as well stretching my own. 
      </p>

        I love working at the Guardian and I get to work on initatives that align with the Guardian values. I've helped the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/gnmeducationcentre">Guardian Education Centre</a> create a coding workshop for school students. They have used the same workshop as an introductory session to coding for both internal staff and <a href="http://gu.com/p/4ey6t">Computer Science in Action</a> courses. At the these events I often pop down to give a short talk about software developers, the projects we work on and how a product is formed.
      </p>

      <p>
        This year (2016) we are going to colloborate with <a href="http://www.codefirstgirls.org.uk/">Code First Girls</a> to run introductory coding classes for young women. This should be very exciting and hopefully I'll write about our experiences later this year.
      </p>

      <p>I am not a big writer but I've written a couple <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/jenny-sivapalan">posts</a> for the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/info/developer-blog">Guardian Developer Blog</a>.
      </p>

      
      <p> 
        Outside of work I can often be found on Clapham Common at <a href="http://www.britmilfit.com">BMF</a> and in the summer co-captaining the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/claphamsoftballclub">Mob</a> <a href="http://www.claphamsoftballclub.co.uk/"> softball team </a>.
        I like to try a new activity each year, 2014 was the ukulele (result: I'm not musically talented), 2015 was yoga (I like the parts where you lie down for ages) and for 2016 I've decided to try Fencing...
        When I'm not doing any of that I'll probably be on my sofa with a cup of tea.
